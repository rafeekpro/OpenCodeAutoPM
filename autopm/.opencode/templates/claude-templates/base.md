## 🚨 AGENT USAGE - MANDATORY

**CRITICAL: You MUST use specialized agents for ALL non-trivial tasks.**

See: `.opencode/rules/agent-mandatory.md` for complete enforcement rules.

### Quick Reference - When to Use Agents:

| Task Type | Agent | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Python code | `python-backend-engineer` | Build FastAPI endpoint |
| React/UI | `react-frontend-engineer` | Create dashboard component |
| Testing | `test-runner` | Run test suite |
| Database | `postgresql-expert`, `mongodb-expert` | Design schema |
| DevOps | `kubernetes-orchestrator`, `docker-containerization-expert` | Deploy app |
| Code review | `code-analyzer` | Find bugs/security issues |
| Large files | `file-analyzer` | Parse logs >1000 lines |

**Before doing ANY complex task**: Check if there's a specialized agent. If YES → USE IT!

## USE SUB-AGENTS FOR CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION

### Core Agents (Always Available)

#### file-analyzer - File and log analysis
Always use for reading and summarizing files, especially logs and verbose outputs.

#### code-analyzer - Bug hunting and logic tracing
Use for code analysis, bug detection, and tracing execution paths.

#### test-runner - Test execution and analysis
Use for running tests and analyzing results with structured reports.

#### parallel-worker - Multi-stream parallel execution
Use for coordinating multiple work streams in parallel.

## 🚨 TDD PIPELINE FOR ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🔴 RED → ✅ GREEN → ♻️ REFACTOR                                   ║
║                                                                   ║
║  ZERO TOLERANCE: No code without tests. No exceptions.           ║

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Mandatory Test-Driven Development Cycle

**CRITICAL**: Every implementation MUST follow TDD cycle. This rule has **HIGHEST PRIORITY**.

#### 1. 🔴 RED Phase: Write FAILING Test First

- Write test that describes desired behavior
- Test **MUST FAIL** initially (run `@test-runner` to confirm)
- Test must be meaningful (no trivial assertions)
- **NEVER proceed to code without failing test**

```bash
# Example workflow:
touch tests/test_feature.py
# Write test
@test-runner run tests/test_feature.py  # MUST SEE RED ❌
git commit -m "test: add failing test for feature"
```

#### 2. ✅ GREEN Phase: Write MINIMUM Code to Pass

- Write **MINIMUM** code to pass test
- Don't add features not required by test
- Focus on making test green, not perfection
- Run `@test-runner` to confirm tests pass

```bash
# Implement feature
@test-runner run tests/test_feature.py  # MUST SEE GREEN ✅
git commit -m "feat: implement feature"
```

#### 3. ♻️ REFACTOR Phase: Improve While Tests Stay Green

- Improve code structure
- Remove duplication
- Enhance readability
- **All tests MUST remain green**
- Run `@test-runner` after each change

```bash
# Refactor code
@test-runner run all tests  # ALL MUST BE GREEN ✅
git commit -m "refactor: improve feature structure"
```

### TDD Commit Pattern (MANDATORY)

For EVERY feature, you MUST see this commit sequence:
```bash
git log --oneline
# c3d4e5f refactor: improve feature structure  ♻️
# b2c3d4e feat: implement feature              ✅
# a1b2c3d test: add failing test for feature  🔴
```

**❌ VIOLATIONS (Auto-Reject):**
- Commits with code but no tests
- Commits with "WIP" or "TODO: add tests later"
- Skipping any phase of TDD cycle
- Tests written after implementation

## CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION RULES

See **`.opencode/rules/context-optimization.md`** for detailed context preservation patterns and agent usage requirements.

## ERROR HANDLING PIPELINE

See **`.opencode/rules/development-workflow.md`** for complete error handling and development pipelines.

## WHY THESE RULES EXIST

### Development Quality

- **No partial implementations** → Technical debt compounds exponentially
- **No mock services in tests** → Real bugs hide behind mocks
- **TDD mandatory** → Prevents regression and ensures coverage

### Context Preservation

- **Agent-first search** → Preserves main thread for decisions
- **No verbose outputs** → Maintains conversation clarity
- **10-20% return rule** → Focuses on actionable insights

### Code Integrity

- **No "_fixed" suffixes** → Indicates poor planning
- **No orphan docs** → Documentation should be intentional
- **No mixed concerns** → Maintainability over convenience

## Philosophy

### Error Handling

- **Fail fast** for critical configuration (missing text model)
- **Log and continue** for optional features (extraction model)
- **Graceful degradation** when external services unavailable
- **User-friendly messages** through resilience layer

### Testing

See **`.opencode/rules/test-execution.md`** for testing standards and requirements.

## Tone and Behavior

- Criticism is welcome. Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken.
- Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking.
- Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of.
- Be skeptical.
- Be concise.
- Short summaries are OK, but don't give an extended breakdown unless we are working through the details of a plan.
- Do not flatter, and do not give compliments unless I am specifically asking for your judgement.
- Occasional pleasantries are fine.
- Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask.

## ABSOLUTE RULES

See **`.opencode/rules/naming-conventions.md`** for code quality standards and prohibited patterns.

Key principles:

- NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION
- NO CODE DUPLICATION (always search first)
- IMPLEMENT TEST FOR EVERY FUNCTION (see `.opencode/rules/tdd.enforcement.md`)
- NO CHEATER TESTS (tests must be meaningful)
- Follow all rules defined in `.opencode/rules/` without exception
