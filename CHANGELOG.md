1. **Pre-commit hook** (`pre-commit-clear-reminder.sh`)
   - Detects issue closure in commit messages
   - Displays reminder after commit
   - Creates `.claude/.clear-reminder` file

2. **Session start check** (`check-clear-reminder.sh`)
   - Checks for pending `/clear` reminder
   - Displays warning on new session
   - Shows which issue was closed

3. **Context hygiene rule** (`context-hygiene.md`)
   - Documents when to run `/clear`
   - Explains why it matters
   - Provides workflow examples

4. **Strategy document** (`CONTEXT-HYGIENE-STRATEGY.md`)

```bash
# 1. Close issue
git commit -m "fix: closes #123"
# → Hook shows reminder

# 2. Start new session
claude
# → If reminder pending, shows warning

# 3. Clear context
/clear
# → Reminder removed, ready for next task
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Hard to forget `/clear`
- ✅ Multiple reminder touchpoints
- ✅ Non-blocking (doesn't prevent work)
- ✅ Configurable per project

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - PRD Commands Now Work

This patch release fixes a critical routing issue that prevented all PRD commands from executing.

### Fixed

**Command Routing Issue:**
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting yargs configuration mixing positional parameters with subcommands
- **Impact**: ALL 9 PRD commands were non-functional (silent failures)
- **Solution**: Restructured to proper yargs subcommand architecture

**What Was Broken:**
```bash
$ autopm prd new my-feature
# (complete silence - no output, no error)
```

**Now Works:**
```bash
$ autopm prd new my-feature
🚀 Starting PRD wizard for: my-feature
🚀 Creating New PRD: my-feature
══════════════════════════════════
```

### Technical Changes

- Changed command structure from `prd <action> [name]` to `prd` with proper subcommands
- Added handler parameter to all .command() definitions (required by yargs)
- Removed conflicting positional parameter routing
- Each subcommand now has dedicated handler function

### Verified Working

All 9 PRD commands now functional:
- ✅ `list` - Lists all PRDs
- ✅ `new <name>` - Interactive wizard
- ✅ `show <name>` - Display content
- ✅ `edit <name>` - Open in editor
- ✅ `status <name>` - Status report
- ✅ `parse <name>` - AI analysis
- ✅ `extract-epics <name>` - Epic extraction
- ✅ `summarize <name>` - Generate summary
- ✅ `validate <name>` - Structure validation

### Migration Guide

**For Existing Users:**

**No changes required!** The v2.0.0 release is fully backward compatible:

```bash
# Old workflow still works
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
autopm prd:generate my-feature

# New recommended workflow (more secure)
autopm config:init                    # Set master password
autopm config:set-api-key claude      # Encrypt API key
autopm prd:generate my-feature        # Auto-loads from config
```

**For New Users:**

1. Install ClaudeAutoPM:
   ```bash
   npm install -g claude-autopm
   ```

2. Initialize configuration:
   ```bash
   autopm config:init
   # Enter master password (min 8 characters)
   ```

3. Set API key:
   ```bash
   autopm config:set-api-key claude
   # Enter your Anthropic API key (will be encrypted)
   ```

4. Start using:
   ```bash
   autopm prd:generate my-feature
   ```

**For Developers Extending AutoPM:**

**Old Pattern (still works):**
```javascript
const PRDService = require('./lib/services/PRDService');
const service = new PRDService({ defaultEffortHours: 10 });
```

**New Pattern (recommended):**
```javascript
const ConfigManager = require('./lib/config/ConfigManager');
const ServiceFactory = require('./lib/utils/ServiceFactory');

const configManager = new ConfigManager();
configManager.setMasterPassword(process.env.AUTOPM_MASTER_PASSWORD);

const factory = new ServiceFactory(configManager);
const service = factory.createPRDService({ defaultEffortHours: 10 });
```

**Custom AI Providers:**
```javascript
const AbstractAIProvider = require('./lib/ai-providers/AbstractAIProvider');

class MyProvider extends AbstractAIProvider {
  async complete(prompt, options = {}) {
    // Implement your provider logic
    // Automatic retry, rate limiting, circuit breaker
  }
}
```

- Memory efficient: < 85MB for large files
- 42 tests passing (95.5% coverage)

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**
- **newest**: Automatically keep version with newest timestamp
- **local**: Always prefer local changes (default for offline work)
- **remote**: Always prefer remote changes (default for team sync)
- **rules-based**: Apply custom resolution rules from config
- **manual**: Mark conflicts with Git-style markers for manual resolution

**Conflict History & Management (lib/conflict-history.js):**
- Comprehensive logging with timestamps and metadata
- Dual storage: in-memory and file-based persistence
- Advanced filtering by strategy, file, date range
- Undo/replay functionality for conflict resolutions
- Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging

**Visual Diff Rendering (lib/visual-diff.js):**
- Side-by-side ASCII comparisons
- Unified diff format support
- Conflict highlighting with markers
- Configurable context lines
- Line number display for easy navigation

**CLI Integration:**
```bash
# Sync with conflict resolution
autopm sync:download --conflict newest    # Use newest timestamp
autopm sync:download --conflict interactive  # Manual resolution
autopm sync:upload --conflict-rules .claude/sync-rules.json

# View conflict history
autopm conflict:history
autopm conflict:history --strategy newest
autopm conflict:undo <conflict-id>
```

### Security

## [1.18.0] - 2025-10-02

### ✨ Feature: MCP Dependency Validation for Teams

**Automatic detection and warnings for missing MCP server dependencies when loading agent teams**

Users requested visibility when agents require MCP servers that aren't installed or activated. This release adds automatic validation during team loading.

### 🎯 What's New

1. **Automatic MCP Dependency Detection:**
   - Scans all agents in a team for MCP server requirements
   - Detects `mcp://server-name/path` URIs in agent documentation
   - Validates against currently active MCP servers
   - Shows warnings with clear fix instructions

2. **Two Types of Warnings:**
   - ❌ **NOT INSTALLED**: Server definition doesn't exist
     - Fix: `autopm mcp install <server-name>`
   - ⚪ **NOT ACTIVE**: Server exists but isn't enabled
     - Fix: `autopm mcp enable <server-name>`

3. **Clear Action Items:**
   - Lists which agents need each missing server
   - Provides exact command to fix the issue
   - Includes helpful tips for MCP configuration

### 📊 Example Output

```bash
$ autopm team load frontend

🔄 Loading team 'frontend'...
   Resolved 9 agents (including inherited)

⚠️  MCP Dependency Warnings:

⚪ MCP server 'context7' is NOT ACTIVE
   Required by: react-frontend-engineer, javascript-frontend-engineer, ux-design-expert
   Fix: autopm mcp enable context7

💡 Tip: Run "autopm mcp list" to see all MCP servers
💡 Tip: Run "autopm mcp setup" for interactive configuration

✓ Updated CLAUDE.md with team agents
✓ Team 'frontend' activated successfully
```

### 🔧 Technical Changes

**Modified Files:**
- `bin/commands/team.js` - Added `validateAgentMCPDependencies()` function
- `bin/commands/team.js` - Integrated MCP validation into team load command

**How It Works:**
1. After resolving team agents, validates MCP dependencies
2. Uses existing MCPHandler to scan agent files for MCP URIs
3. Checks each required server against active servers list
4. Displays warnings for missing/inactive servers
5. Continues with team loading (non-blocking validation)

### 📝 Migration Notes

**For all users:**
- MCP validation happens automatically when loading teams
- No configuration required - works out of the box
- Warnings are informational and don't block team loading

**Affected Agents:**
Many agents now declare MCP dependencies for documentation access:
- `react-frontend-engineer` - Needs context7 for React/Next.js docs
- `python-backend-engineer` - Needs context7 for Python/FastAPI docs
- `javascript-frontend-engineer` - Needs context7 for JS/TS docs
- And many more...

## [1.17.0] - 2025-10-02

Same as v1.15.4 but with corrected version number and proper npm publication.

### 🔧 Changes

- Ensured package.json.template includes js-yaml dependency
- Installer creates package.json and runs npm install
- All PM scripts have required dependencies

## [1.15.4] - 2025-10-02

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Missing Dependencies After Installation

**Fixed installer not creating package.json or installing dependencies**

The installer was not creating `package.json` in user projects, causing PM scripts like `epic-split.js` to fail with "Cannot find module 'js-yaml'" error.

### 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. **Added package.json.template handling:**
   - Template now includes `js-yaml` dependency
   - Installer creates `package.json` from template if it doesn't exist
   - Auto-fills project name from directory name

2. **Added automatic dependency installation:**
   - Installer now runs `npm install` after copying files
   - Only installs if `package.json` has dependencies
   - Provides helpful error message if installation fails

3. **Fixed PM script requirements:**
   - `epic-split.js` now has required `js-yaml` dependency
   - All other PM scripts will have dependencies available

### 📊 Impact

**Before v1.15.4:**
```bash
autopm install
# Creates .claude/ but NO package.json
# User runs /pm:epic-split
# ERROR: Cannot find module 'js-yaml'
```

**After v1.15.4:**
```bash
autopm install
# ✅ Creates package.json with dependencies
# ✅ Runs npm install automatically
# ✅ js-yaml installed and ready
# User runs /pm:epic-split
# ✅ Works perfectly!
```

### 🔧 Technical Changes

**Files Modified:**
- `autopm/scripts/package.json.template` - Added `js-yaml: ^4.1.0`
- `install/install.js` - Added `installDependencies()` method
- `install/install.js` - Added package.json creation logic in `installScripts()`

### 📝 Migration Notes

npm install js-yaml

# Or recreate package.json:
cp autopm/scripts/package.json.template package.json
npm install
```

**For new installations:**
- Everything works automatically! 🎉

## [1.13.13] - 2025-10-01

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix: MCP Server Definition Files

**Fixed incorrect package names in MCP server definition files**

The v1.13.10 and v1.13.11 releases fixed package names in `mcp-servers.json` but forgot to update the individual server definition files in `autopm/.claude/mcp/`. This caused servers to fail validation and not appear in `autopm mcp list`.

### 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Fixed Files:**
- `autopm/.claude/mcp/context7.md`: `@context7/mcp-server` → `@upstash/context7-mcp`
- `autopm/.claude/mcp/context7.md`: `@context7/mcp-server` → `@upstash/context7-mcp`
- `autopm/.claude/mcp/context7.md`: Added missing `https://` to URL defaults
- `autopm/.claude/mcp/playwright-mcp.md`: `@playwright/mcp-server` → `@playwright/mcp`

### 📊 Impact

**Before v1.13.13:**
- `autopm mcp list` showed only context7 servers
- playwright-mcp didn't appear in list
- Server validation failed silently

**After v1.13.13:**
- All servers appear in `autopm mcp list`
- All package names are correct and consistent
- Server validation works properly

### 🔄 Upgrade

```bash
npm install -g claude-autopm@latest
```

## [1.13.12] - 2025-10-01

### ✨ Enhancement: Post-Configuration Guidance

**Added comprehensive next steps after MCP configuration commands**

Users now receive clear, actionable guidance after running:
- `autopm mcp enable <server>`
- `autopm mcp add`
- `autopm mcp sync`

### 🎯 What Changed

**New `showNextSteps()` method in MCPHandler:**
- Shows step-by-step instructions after configuration
- Lists required environment variables with examples
- Provides API key sources and documentation links
- Reminds users to restart Claude Code and verify servers

### 📋 Example Output

**After `autopm mcp enable context7`:**
```
✅ Server 'context7' enabled

📋 Next Steps:

1. Run sync to update configuration:
   autopm mcp sync

2. Configure required environment variables in .claude/.env:
   CONTEXT7_API_KEY=ctx7_1234567890abcdef
   CONTEXT7_WORKSPACE=my-workspace-id

3. Restart Claude Code to load the server

4. Verify server status:
   /mcp (in Claude Code)

💡 API Key Information:
   → Sign up at https://context7.com and get API key from dashboard
```

**After `autopm mcp sync`:**
```
✅ Configuration synced...

📋 Next Steps:

1. Restart Claude Code to load the updated configuration

2. Verify servers are running:
   /mcp (in Claude Code)

⚠️  Some servers require environment variables:

   ❌ CONTEXT7_API_KEY

3. Configure missing variables in .claude/.env

4. Check configuration:
   autopm mcp check
```

### 🎁 User Experience Improvement

**Before v1.13.12:**
- Commands completed silently
- No guidance on what to do next
- Users left confused about how to proceed

**After v1.13.12:**
- Clear step-by-step instructions

## [1.13.11] - 2025-10-01

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Corrected Playwright MCP Package Name

**Fixed incorrect Playwright MCP package name**
- Changed from non-existent `@playwright/mcp-server` to actual `@playwright/mcp`
- **Impact: Playwright MCP server can now start in Claude Code**

### 🗑️ Breaking Change: Removed Deprecated GitHub MCP

**Removed deprecated GitHub MCP server from default configuration**
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` is deprecated by maintainers
- GitHub now provides official server via Copilot API with HTTP transport
- **Impact: Users need to manually add GitHub MCP if needed**

### 🎯 What Changed

**autopm/.claude/mcp-servers.json:**
```json
// Playwright - Fixed:
"args": ["@playwright/mcp"]  // ✅ Was: @playwright/mcp-server

// GitHub - Removed (deprecated)
// Use: claude mcp add --transport http github ...
```

**package.json:**
```json
"optionalDependencies": {
  "@upstash/context7-mcp": "^1.0.0",
  "@playwright/mcp": "^0.0.40"
}
```

### 📊 Default MCP Servers

**After v1.13.11:**
- ✅ `context7` - Documentation (@upstash/context7-mcp)
- ✅ `context7` - Codebase analysis (@upstash/context7-mcp)
- ✅ `playwright-mcp` - Browser automation (@playwright/mcp)
- ❌ `github-mcp` - REMOVED (deprecated)

### 📖 Adding GitHub MCP Manually

**New official GitHub MCP (via Copilot API):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http github \
  https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_PAT"
```

See: https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server

### 🔄 Migration

**For existing projects:**
```bash
cd your-project
autopm mcp sync  # Updates with correct packages
```

## [1.13.10] - 2025-10-01

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

**Fixed Incorrect Context7 MCP Package Name**
- Changed from non-existent `@context7/mcp-server` to actual `@upstash/context7-mcp`
- **Impact: MCP servers can now actually start in Claude Code**

### 🎯 What Was Wrong

The MCP configuration was using a **non-existent npm package**:
- ❌ `@context7/mcp-server` - doesn't exist on npm
- ✅ `@upstash/context7-mcp` - real package

This caused ALL Context7 MCP servers to fail with "✘ failed" in Claude Code.

### 🔧 Files Changed

**autopm/.claude/mcp-servers.json:**
```json
// Before:
"args": ["@context7/mcp-server"]  // ❌ 404 Not Found

// After:
"args": ["@upstash/context7-mcp"]  // ✅ Works
```

**package.json:**
```json
"optionalDependencies": {
  "@upstash/context7-mcp": "^1.0.0"  // Updated
}
```

### 📊 Impact

**Before (v1.13.9):**
```
Claude Code MCP:
❯ 1. context7    ✘ failed
  2. context7        ✘ failed
```

**After (v1.13.10):**
```
Claude Code MCP:
❯ 1. context7    ✓ running
  2. context7        ✓ running
```

### 🚨 Breaking Change

If you manually installed `@context7/mcp-server` (which would fail), you'll need to:
```bash
npm uninstall @context7/mcp-server
npm install @upstash/context7-mcp
```

But most users didn't install anything (because the package didn't exist), so this is just a fix.

### 🎯 User Action Required

**For existing projects:**
```bash
cd your-project
autopm mcp sync  # Updates .mcp.json with correct package
```

Or manually update `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "args": ["@upstash/context7-mcp"]  // Change this
    }
  }
}
```

### 🔍 How This Happened

The Context7 MCP server is maintained by Upstash, but the configuration examples used an incorrect namespace. The package search revealed:
- ✅ `@upstash/context7-mcp` - Official package (v1.0.20)
- ❌ `@context7/mcp-server` - Never existed

## [1.13.9] - 2025-10-01

### 🎨 UX Improvement

**Enhanced Configuration Display (`autopm config show`)**
- Fixed confusing MCP status messages
- Added helpful configuration instructions
- Shows exact steps to fix missing settings
- **Impact: Users now know exactly how to configure AutoPM**

### 🎯 What Changed

**`bin/commands/config.js`:**
- Fixed MCP status display - now shows "X active", "X configured", or "Not configured"
- Checks both `config.mcp.activeServers` and `.claude/mcp-servers.json`
- Added "Configuration Issues" section with actionable solutions
- Shows exactly how to set GitHub owner, repo, and token
- Shows how to set Azure organization, project, and PAT
- Fixed execution strategy display when it's an object
- Made `padRight()` safer by converting all inputs to strings

### 📊 Before vs After

**Before (v1.13.8):**
```
│ MCP:             ❌ Disabled             │
```
*User confused: "I have servers configured!"*

**After (v1.13.9):**
```
│ MCP:             ⚠️  2 configured       │
```
```
📋 Configuration Issues:

⚠️  GitHub token not set
   → Add to .claude/.env: GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

ℹ️  2 MCP server(s) configured but not active
   → Run: autopm mcp list  (then: autopm mcp enable <server>)
```

### 🎯 User Impact

✅ Clear MCP status (active vs configured vs missing)
✅ Actionable instructions for every missing setting
✅ Shows exact commands to run
✅ Shows where to add tokens (.claude/.env)
✅ No more confusion about configuration state

### 🔧 Technical Details

**MCP Status Logic:**
1. If `config.mcp.activeServers` exists → show "X active" ✅
2. Else check `.claude/mcp-servers.json` → show "X configured" ⚠️
3. Else → show "Not configured" ❌

**Configuration Issues:**
- Detects missing provider, owner, repo, tokens
- Shows platform-specific instructions (GitHub vs Azure)
- Different icon per issue type (⚠️ for problems, ℹ️ for info)

## [1.13.8] - 2025-10-01

### ✨ Feature

**Automatic MCP Integration During Installation**
- Installation now automatically creates `.mcp.json` for Claude Code

- Added `setupMCPIntegration()` method called after framework installation
- Automatically creates `.mcp.json` when `mcp-servers.json` exists
- Shows helpful tip if no servers are activated

### 📊 Installation Flow

**Before (v1.13.7):**
```
1. autopm install
2. autopm mcp enable context7  ← Manual step
3. autopm mcp sync                  ← Manual step
4. Restart Claude Code              ← Manual step
```

**After (v1.13.8):**
```
1. autopm install                   ← Creates .mcp.json automatically!
2. autopm mcp enable context7  (optional - to activate)
3. Restart Claude Code
```

### 🎯 User Impact

- ✅ `.mcp.json` created automatically during installation
- ✅ 4 MCP servers configured out of the box (context7, context7, github-mcp, playwright-mcp)
- ✅ No extra commands needed for Claude Code integration

- `.mcp.json` - Claude Code format (auto-generated)

### 💡 Post-Installation

Users can now:
- See servers immediately in Claude Code `/mcp` command
- Run `autopm mcp enable <server>` to activate specific servers
- Run `autopm mcp check` to see environment requirements
- Edit `.claude/.env` to add API keys

## [1.13.7] - 2025-10-01

### 🔧 Critical Fix

**Claude Code MCP Integration**
- Fixed `autopm mcp sync` to create `.mcp.json` in project root
- Claude Code expects MCP config in `.mcp.json`, not `.claude/mcp-servers.json`
- **Impact: Claude Code `/mcp` command now correctly discovers MCP servers**

### 🎯 What Changed

**`scripts/mcp-handler.js`:**
- Modified `sync()` to write two files:
  1. `.claude/mcp-servers.json` - AutoPM internal format (with contextPools, documentationSources)
  2. `.mcp.json` - Claude Code format (mcpServers only)
- Added console output showing both file locations
- Uses `this.projectRoot` to write `.mcp.json` at project root

### 📊 File Structure

**Before (v1.13.6):**
```
project/
  .claude/
    mcp-servers.json    ✅ Created
  .mcp.json             ❌ Missing (Claude Code couldn't find servers)
```

**After (v1.13.7):**
```
project/
  .claude/
    mcp-servers.json    ✅ Created (AutoPM format)
  .mcp.json             ✅ Created (Claude Code format)
```

### 🎯 User Impact

- ✅ Claude Code `/mcp` command shows configured servers
- ✅ MCP servers discoverable by Claude Code
- ✅ Automatic sync to both file formats
- ✅ No manual configuration needed
- ✅ Works across all projects after running `autopm mcp sync`

### 📖 Documentation

Claude Code expects MCP configuration in:
- **Project scope**: `.mcp.json` at project root
- **Local scope**: User-specific Claude Code settings
- **User scope**: Global Claude Code settings

AutoPM now correctly creates project-scoped configuration.

## [1.13.6] - 2025-10-01

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**MCP Environment Variable Format**
- Fixed `autopm mcp sync` copying metadata objects instead of simple strings
- Claude Code expects `"VAR": "value"` not `"VAR": {default: "value"}`
- Added `_convertEnvMetadataToStrings()` to convert registry metadata to Claude Code format
- **Impact: Claude Code `/mcp` command now works correctly**

### 🔧 Technical Changes

**`scripts/mcp-handler.js`:**
- Added `_convertEnvMetadataToStrings(envObj)` helper method
- Converts env metadata objects to simple string format
- Handles three cases:
  1. Already string → keep unchanged
  2. Metadata with literal default → use literal value
  3. Metadata with empty default → use `${VAR:-}` format
- Modified `sync()` to use conversion before writing

### 📊 Format Conversion

**Before (v1.13.5):**
```json
"env": {
  "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": {              // ❌ Object
    "default": "",
    "description": "Your Context7 API key",
    "required": true
  }
}
```

**After (v1.13.6):**
```json
"env": {
  "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "${CONTEXT7_API_KEY:-}",  // ✅ String
  "CONTEXT7_MODE": "documentation"                // ✅ Literal
}
```

### 🎯 User Impact

- ✅ Claude Code can parse MCP configurations
- ✅ `/mcp` command shows servers correctly
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing formats
- ✅ Preserves literal defaults from registry
- ✅ MCP servers now work in Claude Code interface

## [1.13.5] - 2025-10-01

### 🚨 Critical Bug Fix

**MCP Sync Data Loss Bug**
- Fixed critical bug in `autopm mcp sync` that deleted all MCP server configurations
- Previously: Running sync with no active servers would wipe entire `mcp-servers.json`
- Now: Preserves all existing servers, only updates active ones
- Impact: **Safe to run `autopm mcp sync` anytime without data loss**

### 🔧 Technical Changes

**`scripts/mcp-handler.js`:**
- `sync()` now reads existing `mcp-servers.json` before modifying
- Preserves all servers, updates only those in `activeServers` list
- When no active servers: preserves existing instead of wiping file
- Better logging: shows both active count and total servers count

**`.claude/config.json`:**
- Added `mcp.activeServers` section for Claude Code integration
- Enables `/mcp` command in Claude Code to see configured servers
- Without this section, Claude Code shows "No MCP servers configured"

### 📊 Behavior Change

**Before:**
```bash
$ autopm mcp sync  # with empty activeServers
ℹ️ No active servers to sync
# Result: ALL servers deleted from mcp-servers.json ❌
```

**After:**
```bash
$ autopm mcp sync  # with empty activeServers
ℹ️ No active servers in config.json
💡 Preserving existing servers in mcp-servers.json
📊 Existing servers: 4
# Result: All servers preserved ✅
```

### 🎯 User Impact

- ✅ No more data loss when syncing
- ✅ Claude Code `/mcp` command now works
- ✅ Safe to run `autopm mcp sync` anytime
- ✅ All existing servers preserved automatically

### 🔄 Recovery for Affected Users

If you lost your MCP configuration, restore it:
```bash
# Restore from git
git checkout .claude/mcp-servers.json

# Or re-enable servers
autopm mcp enable context7
autopm mcp enable github-mcp
```
