# User Guide

Welcome to the ClaudeAutoPM User Guide. This comprehensive documentation will help you master the automated project management system and leverage AI agents to accelerate your development workflow.

## What You Will Learn

This guide covers everything you need to become productive with ClaudeAutoPM:

@docker-containerization-expert create optimized Dockerfile
```

## Understanding the ClaudeAutoPM Philosophy

ClaudeAutoPM is built on three core principles:

### 1. Spec-Driven Development

Every feature starts with a specification. PRDs define what to build, epics break it down into manageable pieces, and tasks become the atomic units of work. This traceability ensures nothing gets lost between idea and implementation.

### 2. AI-Assisted Automation

Specialized AI agents handle specific domains of expertise. Rather than one general-purpose assistant, you have access to experts in React, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and more. Each agent knows its domain deeply and can coordinate with others.

### 3. Provider Flexibility

Whether you use GitHub Issues or Azure DevOps, ClaudeAutoPM abstracts the underlying provider. Your workflow remains consistent while the system handles provider-specific details.
