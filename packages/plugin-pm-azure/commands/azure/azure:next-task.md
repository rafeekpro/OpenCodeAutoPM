# Azure DevOps Next Task

Get AI-powered recommendation for the next task to work on based on priorities, dependencies, and capacity.

**Usage**: `/azure:next-task [--user=<email>] [--auto-start]`

**Examples**:
- `/azure:next-task` - Get your next recommended task
- `/azure:next-task --auto-start` - Get and immediately start the task
- `/azure:next-task --user=sarah@example.com` - Recommend for specific user

## Required Environment Variables

Ensure `.opencode/.env` contains:

```bash
AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT=<your-pat-token>
AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG=<your-organization>
AZURE_DEVOPS_PROJECT=<your-project>
```

## Required Documentation Access

**MANDATORY:** Before Azure DevOps integration and agile workflows, query Context7 for best practices:

**Documentation Queries:**
- `mcp://context7/azure-devops/boards` - boards best practices
- `mcp://context7/agile/user-stories` - user stories best practices
- `mcp://context7/project-management/work-items` - work items best practices
- `mcp://context7/agile/sprint-planning` - sprint planning best practices

**Why This is Required:**
- Ensures adherence to current industry standards and best practices
- Prevents outdated or incorrect implementation patterns
- Provides access to latest framework/tool documentation
- Reduces errors from stale knowledge or assumptions


## Instructions

### 1. Analyze Context

Use azure-devops-specialist agent to analyze:
- Current sprint goals
- User's active tasks
- Task dependencies
- Priority scores
- Team capacity
- Blockers

### 2. Recommendation Algorithm

Score tasks based on:
- **Priority**: Critical > High > Medium > Low
- **Dependencies**: Unblocked tasks first
- **Sprint goals**: Align with sprint objectives
- **Story completion**: Prefer finishing stories
- **Skills match**: Match user expertise
- **Time available**: Fit within capacity

### 3. Display Recommendation
