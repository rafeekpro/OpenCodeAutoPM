# OpenCodeAutoPM Standard Python Dockerfile Template
# Features:
# - Multi-stage build for efficiency
# - System-wide package installation (works with non-root user)
# - Non-root user for security
# - Health checks
# - Proper signal handling

# Stage 1: Builder
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder

# Install build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install Python dependencies to SYSTEM location (not --user)
# This is CRITICAL for multi-stage builds with non-root runtime
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM python:3.11-slim AS runtime

# Install runtime dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy Python installation from builder (SYSTEM-wide, not /root/.local)
# This allows non-root user to execute binaries
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin

# Create non-root user
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash appuser

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Change ownership to appuser
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

# Run application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
