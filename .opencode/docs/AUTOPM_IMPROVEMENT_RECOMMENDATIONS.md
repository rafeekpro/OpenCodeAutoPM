## System Architecture Overview

### How autopm/.opencode/ Directory Works

The `autopm/.opencode/` directory is the **framework source** that gets copied to user projects during installation:

```
autopm/.opencode/              # Framework source (copied during install)
├── agents/                  # Specialized agent definitions
│   ├── core/               # Core agents (code-analyzer, test-runner, etc.)
│   ├── languages/          # Language-specific agents (python, nodejs, etc.)
│   ├── cloud/              # Cloud platform agents (AWS, Azure, GCP)
│   ├── databases/          # Database agents (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
│   └── AGENT-REGISTRY.md   # Complete agent catalog
│
├── commands/               # Slash command definitions
│   └── pm/                # Project management commands
│       ├── prd-new.md
│       ├── prd-parse.md
│       ├── epic-decompose.md
│       └── epic-sync.md
│
├── scripts/               # Implementation scripts
│   └── pm/               # PM command implementations
│       ├── prd-new.js
│       ├── prd-parse.js
│       └── epic-sync/    # Modular epic sync scripts
│
├── rules/                # Behavioral rules and constraints
│   ├── tdd.enforcement.md
│   ├── agent-mandatory.md
│   ├── datetime.md
│   ├── git-strategy.md
│   └── naming-conventions.md
│
├── prds/                 # Product Requirements Documents (user-created)
├── epics/                # Technical implementation epics (user-created)
└── config.json           # Project configuration
```

**Installation Flow**:
```
User runs: autopm install
  ↓
Copies: autopm/.opencode/ → /user/project/.opencode/
  ↓
User project now has full framework
```

### How /pm: Commands Work

Commands follow this execution flow:

```
1. User executes: /pm:prd-new feature-name
                        ↓
2. Claude reads: autopm/.opencode/commands/pm/prd-new.md
                        ↓
3. Command specifies: Run node .opencode/scripts/pm/prd-new.js
                        ↓
4. Script executes with ARGUMENTS substitution
                        ↓
5. Script creates output in .opencode/prds/
```

**Key Pattern**: Commands are declarative wrappers around executable scripts. This separation allows:
- Command documentation in markdown
- Implementation in JavaScript/Bash
- Easy testing of scripts independently

### Where Rules Are Called

Rules are referenced but NOT automatically enforced. Current system:

**❌ Current Behavior (Passive)**:
```markdown
# In autopm/.opencode/commands/pm/epic-decompose.md
## Required Rules
- `autopm/.opencode/rules/datetime.md` - For getting real current date/time
```

This is just a reminder to Claude, **not automatic enforcement**.

**✅ Desired Behavior (Active)**:
Rules should be programmatically loaded and enforced by scripts.

### Where Agents Are Specified

Currently agents are:
- **Documented** in `autopm/.opencode/agents/` directory
- **Referenced** in `CLAUDE.md` and command files
- **Invoked** manually by Claude using Task tool

**Problem**: Agent selection is manual and relies on Claude remembering to check available agents.

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Missing Pre-PRD Codebase Analysis

**Current Behavior**:
```bash
/pm:prd-new authentication
  ↓
Creates PRD immediately with interactive prompts
  ↓
No verification if "authentication" already exists in codebase
```

**Problem**:
- Users may create PRDs for features that already exist
- Leads to duplicate implementations
- Wastes development effort

**User Requirement**:
> Before any "prd-new" command where it creates the PRD we should always:
> - Force correct answers
> - Prevent guessing
> - Show precisely how to search the project
> - Verify if functionality already exists
> - Only then proceed with PRD creation

**Impact**: HIGH - Prevents duplicate work and ensures informed decisions

---

### Issue #2: Interactive Prompts Incompatible with OpenCode

**Current Behavior** (in `autopm/.opencode/scripts/pm/prd-new.js`):
```javascript
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

const prompt = (question) => new Promise((resolve) => {
  rl.question(question, resolve);
});

// Interactive prompts
prdData.vision = await prompt('Vision: ');
prdData.users = await prompt('Target users: ');
// ... more prompts
```

**Problem**:
- OpenCode terminal is **non-interactive**
- Users cannot type responses to prompts
- Command hangs waiting for input
- Completely blocks workflow

**User Report**:
> There is an issue with PRDs. It always expects some interactive response when we are using it in OpenCode. Therefore we cannot answer in the terminal because it is opened in OpenCode terminal. We should change that!

**Impact**: CRITICAL - Makes command completely unusable in OpenCode

---

### Issue #3: Missing Agent Specification in epic-decompose

**Current Behavior** (in `autopm/.opencode/commands/pm/epic-decompose.md`):
```markdown
### 3. Parallel Task Creation (When Possible)

If tasks can be created in parallel, spawn sub-agents:

Task:
  description: "Create task files batch {X}"
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"  # ⚠️ Too generic!
```

**Problem**:
- Uses generic "general-purpose" agent
- Doesn't specify which specialized agent to use
- No path to agent configuration file
- Misses opportunity for specialized agents

**User Requirement**:
> Given an understanding of the PRD, we should specifically relate the agents that must be used for that task. It's really important to enumerate and add the specific path of the agent configuration, usually: "@.opencode/agents"

**Example of What's Needed**:
```markdown
Epic: User Authentication System

Required Agents:
- @.opencode/agents/languages/python-backend-expert.md (API implementation)
- @.opencode/agents/databases/postgresql-expert.md (user schema)
- @.opencode/agents/testing/frontend-testing-engineer.md (test suite)
- @.opencode/agents/cloud/aws-cloud-architect.md (deployment)
```

**Impact**: HIGH - Reduces efficiency and misses specialized agent capabilities

---

### Issue #4: Missing GitHub Issue Documentation Links in epic-sync

**Current Behavior** (in `autopm/.opencode/scripts/pm/epic-sync/`):
- Creates GitHub issues
- Updates local files with issue numbers
- **Does NOT** add comments linking to local documentation

**Problem**:
- GitHub issues lack context about local documentation
- Developers don't know where to find detailed specs
- Disconnect between GitHub and local project structure

**User Requirement**:
> In "/pm:epic-sync" we must do as critical: write the Epics we've created and add them as a comment to GitHub issues + the path where the specific issue documentation is. Usually ".opencode/epics/{prd-name}/{issue-number}"

**Example of What's Needed**:

When creating GitHub issue #123, should add comment:
```markdown
📁 **Local Documentation**

Epic: `.opencode/epics/authentication/epic.md`
Task: `.opencode/epics/authentication/123.md`

See local files for complete technical specifications and acceptance criteria.
```

**Impact**: HIGH - Improves developer experience and maintains documentation traceability

---

### Issue #5: Incorrect GitHub Issue Number Mapping

**Current Behavior**:
- Local task files numbered sequentially: `001.md`, `002.md`, `003.md`
- GitHub creates issues: `#5`, `#6`, `#7`
- Files renamed but numbering doesn't match GitHub sequence

**Problem**:
- Confusing file numbering
- Difficult to correlate local files with GitHub issues
- Mental overhead for developers

**User Requirement**:
> We should always use the numbering of the GitHub issue. For example:
>
> If we created the last issue in GitHub #3 and it is the first issue of an epic:
> - Epic (epic.md) = #4
> - First issue (5.md) = #5
>
> So the numbering of the local files should be related to the issues on GitHub.

**Current Broken Flow**:
```bash
# Local files created
.opencode/epics/auth/001.md
.opencode/epics/auth/002.md
.opencode/epics/auth/003.md

# GitHub issues created
GitHub: #45 (epic)
GitHub: #46 (task 1)
GitHub: #47 (task 2)
GitHub: #48 (task 3)

# Files renamed (INCORRECT)
.opencode/epics/auth/epic.md  # Should reference #45
.opencode/epics/auth/001.md   # Should be 46.md
.opencode/epics/auth/002.md   # Should be 47.md
.opencode/epics/auth/003.md   # Should be 48.md
```

**Correct Flow Should Be**:
```bash
# After sync, files should be:
.opencode/epics/auth/epic.md  # References #45
.opencode/epics/auth/46.md    # Matches GitHub #46
.opencode/epics/auth/47.md    # Matches GitHub #47
.opencode/epics/auth/48.md    # Matches GitHub #48
```

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Quality of life improvement, reduces cognitive load

---

### Issue #6: Context Memory Consumption by Unused Rules

**Problem Statement**: AutoPM ships with 44 rules files in `autopm/.opencode/rules/` directory. All rules are loaded into OpenCode's context on every conversation, consuming significant memory even when not relevant to the project.

**Real-World Impact** (from Trading Project):
- **BEFORE**: ~67,000 tokens (~33.5% of 200k context limit)
- **AFTER**: ~21,000 tokens (~10.5% of context limit)
- **REDUCTION**: 68% decrease in rules context usage
- **Files Archived**: 28 unused rules → `.opencode/rules-archive/`

**User Report**:
> "I discontinued here specific rules I don't use and add to the context memory. Therefore I archive them. But because AutoPM is for general use, some of these files I archived may be important and some I use on this project may not. So we should add to the documentation: when installing AutoPM (`autopm install`), we should have this in mind for context memory reduction!"

**Impact**: HIGH - Affects all AutoPM users, 50-70% context reduction possible

## Specific Change Recommendations

### Recommendation #1: Add Pre-PRD Codebase Analysis Phase

**File to Modify**: `autopm/.opencode/commands/pm/prd-new.md`

**Current Implementation**:
```markdown
## Instructions

Run `node .opencode/scripts/pm/prd-new.js $ARGUMENTS` using the Bash tool
```

**Recommended Implementation**:
```markdown
## Instructions

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis (MANDATORY)

Before creating the PRD, perform comprehensive codebase analysis:

1. **Search for Existing Functionality**
   ```bash
   # Use specialized agents for thorough search
   Task:
     subagent_type: "code-analyzer"
     description: "Search for existing '$ARGUMENTS' functionality"
     prompt: |
       Search the entire codebase for anything related to: $ARGUMENTS

       Search criteria:
       - Function names containing: $ARGUMENTS
       - File names related to: $ARGUMENTS
       - Comments/documentation mentioning: $ARGUMENTS
       - Similar patterns or implementations

       Return findings in this format:

       ## Existing Implementations Found
       - File: [path] - [brief description]
       - Function: [name] - [what it does]

       ## Similar Patterns
       - [description of similar functionality]

       ## Recommendation
       ✅ Safe to create new PRD (no conflicts found)
       OR
       ⚠️ Existing functionality detected - review before proceeding

       ## Reusable Components
       - [list components that can be reused]
   ```

2. **Analyze Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Check for related systems
   Task:
     subagent_type: "code-analyzer"
     description: "Identify dependencies for '$ARGUMENTS'"
     prompt: |
       Identify systems that '$ARGUMENTS' would interact with:
       - Databases
       - APIs
       - External services
       - Internal modules

       Return integration points and potential conflicts.
   ```

3. **Present Findings to User**
   ```markdown
   📊 Codebase Analysis Results for: $ARGUMENTS

   ✅ Existing Implementations: [count]
   [List each implementation with file path and purpose]

   🔗 Dependencies Identified: [count]
   [List each dependency]

   ♻️  Reusable Components: [count]
   [List components that can be leveraged]

   ⚠️ Potential Conflicts: [count]
   [List any conflicts or duplications]

   ---

   Based on this analysis:

   OPTION 1: Create new PRD (if no conflicts)
   OPTION 2: Extend existing feature (if similar found)
   OPTION 3: Refactor existing code (if duplication detected)

   Proceed with: /pm:prd-new $ARGUMENTS --confirmed
   ```

4. **Require Explicit Confirmation**
   Only proceed to PRD creation after user reviews analysis and confirms.

### Phase 2: PRD Creation

After confirmation, run: `node .opencode/scripts/pm/prd-new.js $ARGUMENTS`
```

**Files to Create**:
- `autopm/.opencode/scripts/pm/analyze-codebase.js` - Pre-PRD analysis script
- `autopm/.opencode/rules/pre-prd-analysis.md` - Analysis requirements and patterns

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents duplicate implementations
- ✅ Identifies reusable components
- ✅ Surfaces integration points early
- ✅ Informed decision-making

---

### Recommendation #2: Replace Interactive Prompts with LLM-Based Generation

**File to Modify**: `autopm/.opencode/scripts/pm/prd-new.js`

**Current Problematic Code**:
```javascript
// ❌ PROBLEM: Interactive prompts don't work in OpenCode
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

prdData.vision = await prompt('Vision: ');
prdData.users = await prompt('Target users: ');
```

**Recommended Replacement**:
```javascript
// ✅ SOLUTION: Use Claude to generate PRD content

async createPrd(prdName) {
  console.log(`\n🚀 Creating PRD for: ${prdName}`);
  console.log(`Using AI-assisted generation...\n`);

  // Instead of prompts, have Claude analyze and generate
  const prdContent = await this.generatePrdWithClaude(prdName);

  // Write PRD file
  fs.writeFileSync(prdFile, prdContent);

  console.log('✅ PRD created successfully!');
  console.log(`📄 File: ${prdFile}`);
  console.log('\n💡 Review and edit: nano ' + prdFile);
  console.log('Then proceed with: /pm:prd-parse ' + prdName);
}

generatePrdWithClaude(prdName) {
  // Return prompt for Claude to generate PRD
  // Claude will use codebase analysis + context to create comprehensive PRD
  return `
    Based on the codebase analysis for "${prdName}", generate a comprehensive PRD.

    Use the template from autopm/.opencode/templates/prd-template.md
    Fill in sections based on:
    - Codebase analysis results
    - Project context and architecture
    - Existing patterns and conventions
    - Integration points identified

    Generate realistic content, not placeholders.
  `;
}
```

**Update Command File**: `autopm/.opencode/commands/pm/prd-new.md`
```markdown
## Instructions

You will generate a comprehensive PRD for: **$ARGUMENTS**

### Step 1: Load Context
Read the codebase analysis results from Phase 1 (see Recommendation #1).

### Step 2: Analyze Project Architecture
Review:
- Existing project structure
- Technology stack
- Coding patterns
- Integration points

### Step 3: Generate PRD Content
Create a detailed PRD using template: `autopm/.opencode/templates/prd-template.md`

Fill in ALL sections with realistic content:
- Executive Summary (based on codebase analysis)
- Problem Statement (identify real gaps)
- Target Users (analyze current user base)
- Key Features (aligned with architecture)
- Technical Requirements (match tech stack)
- Success Metrics (relevant to project)

### Step 4: Write PRD File
Save to: `.opencode/prds/$ARGUMENTS.md`

### Step 5: Present for Review
Show summary and suggest:
- Edit: `nano .opencode/prds/$ARGUMENTS.md`
- Continue: `/pm:prd-parse $ARGUMENTS`
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Works in OpenCode (no terminal interaction)
- ✅ Generates higher quality PRDs (uses context)
- ✅ Faster workflow (no manual prompts)
- ✅ Consistent formatting

---

### Recommendation #3: Specify Required Agents in epic-decompose

**File to Modify**: `autopm/.opencode/commands/pm/epic-decompose.md`

**Add New Section** (insert after frontmatter, before instructions):
```markdown
## Agent Selection Strategy

Based on the PRD content, automatically determine required agents:

### Step 1: Analyze PRD for Technology Stack

Read `.opencode/prds/$ARGUMENTS.md` and identify:
- Programming languages mentioned
- Frameworks required
- Infrastructure needs
- Testing requirements
- Deployment targets

### Step 2: Map to Specialized Agents

**Programming Languages**:
- Python → `.opencode/agents/languages/python-backend-expert.md`
- JavaScript/TypeScript → `.opencode/agents/languages/nodejs-backend-engineer.md`
- React → `.opencode/agents/frontend/react-frontend-engineer.md`
- Bash/Shell → `.opencode/agents/languages/bash-scripting-expert.md`

**Databases**:
- PostgreSQL → `.opencode/agents/databases/postgresql-expert.md`
- MongoDB → `.opencode/agents/databases/mongodb-expert.md`
- Redis → `.opencode/agents/databases/redis-expert.md`

**Cloud Platforms**:
- AWS → `.opencode/agents/cloud/aws-cloud-architect.md`
- Azure → `.opencode/agents/cloud/azure-cloud-architect.md`
- GCP → `.opencode/agents/cloud/gcp-cloud-architect.md`

**Infrastructure**:
- Docker → `.opencode/agents/containers/docker-containerization-expert.md`
- Kubernetes → `.opencode/agents/orchestration/kubernetes-orchestrator.md`
- Terraform → `.opencode/agents/infrastructure/terraform-infrastructure-expert.md`

**Testing**:
- Unit/Integration → `.opencode/agents/core/test-runner.md`
- E2E Testing → `.opencode/agents/testing/frontend-testing-engineer.md`

**DevOps**:
- GitHub → `.opencode/agents/ci-cd/github-operations-specialist.md`
- Azure DevOps → `.opencode/agents/ci-cd/azure-devops-specialist.md`

### Step 3: Document Agent Assignments

Add to epic.md frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: feature-name
status: backlog
created: 2025-12-17T10:00:00Z
updated: 2025-12-17T10:00:00Z
required_agents:
  - path: .opencode/agents/languages/python-backend-expert.md
    role: API implementation
    tasks: [001, 002, 003]
  - path: .opencode/agents/databases/postgresql-expert.md
    role: Database schema
    tasks: [004, 005]
  - path: .opencode/agents/testing/frontend-testing-engineer.md
    role: Test suite
    tasks: [006, 007]
---
```

### Step 4: Update Task Files with Agent Assignment

Each task file should specify which agent will handle it:
```yaml
---
name: Implement user authentication API
status: open
assigned_agent: .opencode/agents/languages/python-backend-expert.md
agent_parameters:
  framework: fastapi
  auth_method: jwt
---
```
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic agent selection based on technology
- ✅ Clear agent responsibilities
- ✅ Easier task assignment
- ✅ Better parallel execution planning

---

### Recommendation #4: Add Documentation Links to GitHub Issues

**File to Modify**: `autopm/.opencode/scripts/pm/epic-sync/create-epic-issue.sh`

**Add After Issue Creation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# In create-epic-issue.sh

# ... existing epic creation code ...

# After epic issue is created
epic_number=$(gh issue create --title "$title" --body-file "$body_file" --label "epic" --json number -q .number)

# NEW: Add comment with local documentation links
cat > /tmp/epic-comment.md <<EOF
📁 **Local Documentation**

This epic is tracked locally at:
- Epic file: \`.opencode/epics/$EPIC_NAME/epic.md\`
- PRD: \`.opencode/prds/$PRD_NAME.md\`

**For developers**: Clone the repository and review these files for complete technical specifications, acceptance criteria, and implementation details.

**File Structure**:
\`\`\`
.opencode/epics/$EPIC_NAME/
├── epic.md           # This epic
├── 001.md           # Task 1 (will be issue #XX)
├── 002.md           # Task 2 (will be issue #XX)
└── ...
\`\`\`

Tasks will be created as sub-issues and linked here.
EOF

gh issue comment $epic_number --body-file /tmp/epic-comment.md

echo "✅ Added documentation links to issue #$epic_number"
```

**File to Modify**: `autopm/.opencode/scripts/pm/epic-sync/create-task-issues.sh`

**Add After Each Task Issue Creation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# In create-task-issues.sh

# ... existing task creation code ...

# After creating task issue
task_number=$(gh issue create --title "$title" --body-file "$body_file" --label "task,epic:$EPIC_NAME" --json number -q .number)

# NEW: Add comment with local documentation link
cat > /tmp/task-comment.md <<EOF
📁 **Local Documentation**

Task file: \`.opencode/epics/$EPIC_NAME/${task_number}.md\`

**This file contains**:
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation notes
- Dependencies and blockers
- Testing requirements
- Agent assignment

**Update this file** as you work on the task to track progress locally.
EOF

gh issue comment $task_number --body-file /tmp/task-comment.md

# Update mapping with issue number
echo "$task_file:$task_number" >> $MAPPING_FILE
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Clear link between GitHub and local docs
- ✅ Developers know where to find details
- ✅ Maintains documentation traceability
- ✅ Improves onboarding for new team members

---

### Recommendation #5: Fix GitHub Issue Number Mapping

**File to Modify**: `autopm/.opencode/scripts/pm/epic-sync/update-references.sh`

**Current Code**:
```bash
# ❌ CURRENT: Files numbered sequentially
for task_file in .opencode/epics/$EPIC_NAME/*.md; do
  # Rename 001.md, 002.md, 003.md
  # But doesn't match GitHub issue numbers
done
```

**Recommended Fix**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ✅ IMPROVED: Match GitHub issue numbers exactly

# Read mapping file
# Format: 001:46, 002:47, 003:48
MAPPING_FILE=".opencode/epics/$EPIC_NAME/.github-mapping.txt"

while IFS=: read -r local_number github_number; do
  old_file=".opencode/epics/$EPIC_NAME/${local_number}.md"
  new_file=".opencode/epics/$EPIC_NAME/${github_number}.md"

  if [[ -f "$old_file" ]]; then
    # Rename file to match GitHub issue number
    mv "$old_file" "$new_file"
    echo "Renamed: $old_file → $new_file (GitHub #$github_number)"

    # Update frontmatter with GitHub number
    sed -i "1,/^---$/s/^name: .*/name: Task #$github_number/" "$new_file"
    sed -i "1,/^---$/s|^github: .*|github: https://github.com/$REPO/issues/$github_number|" "$new_file"
  fi
done < "$MAPPING_FILE"

echo "✅ All task files now match GitHub issue numbers"
```

**File to Create**: `autopm/.opencode/scripts/pm/epic-sync/create-github-mapping.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create mapping of local task numbers to GitHub issue numbers

EPIC_NAME=$1
MAPPING_FILE=".opencode/epics/$EPIC_NAME/.github-mapping.txt"

# Initialize mapping file
echo "# Local Task Number : GitHub Issue Number" > "$MAPPING_FILE"

# As each task issue is created, append to mapping
# Called from create-task-issues.sh
append_mapping() {
  local task_number=$1
  local github_number=$2
  echo "$task_number:$github_number" >> "$MAPPING_FILE"
}

export -f append_mapping
```

**Update Workflow** in `autopm/.opencode/commands/pm/epic-sync.md`:
```markdown
### Improved Workflow

1. Create epic issue → Get epic number (e.g., #45)
2. Create task issues → Get task numbers (e.g., #46, #47, #48)
3. **Create mapping file**: `.opencode/epics/$EPIC/.github-mapping.txt`
   ```
   001:46
   002:47
   003:48
   ```
4. **Rename files** to match GitHub numbers:
   ```
   001.md → 46.md
   002.md → 47.md
   003.md → 48.md
   ```
5. **Update all references** in files to use GitHub numbers
6. **Delete old numbered files** (001.md, etc.)

Result: Perfect 1:1 mapping between local files and GitHub issues.
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Intuitive file naming
- ✅ Easy correlation with GitHub
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load
- ✅ Cleaner repository structure

### Recommendation #6: Add Context Optimization Wizard

**File to Create**: `autopm/.opencode/scripts/setup/optimize-context.js`

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
/**
 * AutoPM Context Optimization Wizard
 * Helps users identify and archive unused rules
 */

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const readline = require('readline');

class ContextOptimizer {
  constructor() {
    this.rulesDir = path.join('.opencode', 'rules');
    this.archiveDir = path.join('.opencode', 'rules-archive');

    // Rule categories with descriptions
    this.ruleCategories = {
      'ai-ml': {
        name: 'AI/ML Integration',
        files: [
          'ai-integration-patterns.md',
          'ai-model-standards.md',
          'prompt-engineering-standards.md'
        ],
        question: 'Are you using OpenAI, Gemini, LangChain, or other AI/ML APIs?'
      },
      'cloud': {
        name: 'Cloud Platforms',
        files: [

## Implementation Details

### Priority and Sequencing

**Phase 1 (Immediate - Critical Fixes)**:
1. **Fix interactive prompts** (Recommendation #2) - BLOCKS usage
2. **Add context optimization wizard** (Recommendation #6) - HIGH impact for all users

**Phase 2 (Short-term - High Impact)**:
3. **Add GitHub documentation links** (Recommendation #4) - HIGH value
4. **Add pre-PRD analysis** (Recommendation #1) - Prevents waste
5. **Fix issue numbering** (Recommendation #5) - Quality of life

**Phase 3 (Medium-term - Enhancement)**:
6. **Specify required agents** (Recommendation #3) - Efficiency gain

### Testing Requirements

For each change:

1. **Unit Tests**
   ```bash
   # Test script in isolation
   npm test scripts/pm/prd-new.test.js
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   # Test full workflow
   /pm:prd-new test-feature
   /pm:prd-parse test-feature
   /pm:epic-decompose test-feature
   /pm:epic-sync test-feature
   ```

3. **Regression Tests**
   ```bash
   # Ensure existing functionality works
   ./test/run-all-pm-commands.sh
   ```

### Backward Compatibility

All changes should be backward compatible:
- Old PRD files still work
- Existing epic structures supported
- Gradual migration path for users

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases for Each Recommendation

#### Recommendation #1: Pre-PRD Analysis
```bash
# Test Case 1: No existing functionality
/pm:prd-new completely-new-feature
# Expected: Analysis shows no conflicts, proceeds to PRD creation

# Test Case 2: Existing functionality found
/pm:prd-new authentication
# Expected: Analysis finds existing auth module, warns user, suggests review

# Test Case 3: Similar patterns exist
/pm:prd-new user-management
# Expected: Analysis finds user CRUD operations, suggests extension vs new
```

#### Recommendation #2: Non-Interactive PRD Generation
```bash
# Test Case 1: Create PRD without terminal interaction
/pm:prd-new new-feature
# Expected: PRD generated automatically, no prompts, saves to file

# Test Case 2: Review generated content
cat .opencode/prds/new-feature.md
# Expected: All sections filled with realistic content, not placeholders

# Test Case 3: Edit and continue workflow
nano .opencode/prds/new-feature.md
/pm:prd-parse new-feature
# Expected: Edited PRD parsed correctly
```

#### Recommendation #3: Agent Specification
```bash
# Test Case 1: Python backend epic
/pm:prd-parse python-api
/pm:epic-decompose python-api
# Expected: epic.md contains python-backend-expert in required_agents

# Test Case 2: Full-stack epic
/pm:prd-parse fullstack-app
/pm:epic-decompose fullstack-app
# Expected: epic.md lists python-backend, react-frontend, postgresql agents

# Test Case 3: Infrastructure epic
/pm:prd-parse cloud-migration
/pm:epic-decompose cloud-migration
# Expected: epic.md lists aws-cloud-architect, terraform, kubernetes agents
```

#### Recommendation #4: GitHub Documentation Links
```bash
# Test Case 1: Epic issue has documentation comment
/pm:epic-sync test-feature
# Expected: Epic issue #X has comment with .opencode/epics/test-feature/epic.md path

# Test Case 2: Task issues have documentation comments
# Expected: Each task issue has comment linking to .opencode/epics/test-feature/{number}.md

# Test Case 3: Links are accessible
# Expected: Clicking links in GitHub shows correct local file paths
```

#### Recommendation #5: Issue Number Mapping
```bash
# Test Case 1: Files renamed to match GitHub numbers
/pm:epic-sync test-epic
# Expected:
#   - epic.md references GitHub #45
#   - Task files: 46.md, 47.md, 48.md (matching GitHub issues)
#   - No files named 001.md, 002.md, 003.md

# Test Case 2: Mapping file exists
cat .opencode/epics/test-epic/.github-mapping.txt
# Expected: Contains 001:46, 002:47, 003:48

# Test Case 3: References updated
grep "depends_on" .opencode/epics/test-epic/47.md
# Expected: Shows "depends_on: [46]" not "depends_on: [001]"
```
